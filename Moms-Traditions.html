    <ul>
      <li>At the first of the month the first person in the house-hold to say this first would have good luck all month. “Rabbits, Rabbits, Rabbits,  Hares, Hares, Hares”</li>
      <br>

      <li>To bring in the new year we would open the front door and let the new year in and open the back door and let the old year out. Sometimes the old year required a swift kick out the door.</li>
      <br>

      <li>During Christmas we would always have English pudding, pouring brandy over it, and light it. The pudding would have coins in it wrapped in foil paper. When we were young it was exciting to get the coins out of there.</li>
      <br>

      <li>During Christmas we would also have these English Crackers. You would pull on each side of this decorative cardboard round cylinder and it would make a pop like a fire cracker. Inside would always be a little toy, or hat, and a joke or riddle.</li>
      <br>

      <li>Our mother always felt it was important to celebrate both the Hispanic and British traditions and sometimes she would combine the two. We both remember having mash potatoes and enchiladas on our plate for dinner.</li>
      <br>

      <li>Mom was very big on dressing appropriately for every occasion. Ironed and pressed cloths while working on her car was a requirement. I won’t mention any names, but just ask the tallest son for more details.</li>
      <br>

      <li>We will all miss the food travel bag to go every time we visited her. We couldn’t leave unless we took a banana, orange, apple, piece of cake, or half a pie to go. Even though sometimes we were just going down the street.</li>
      <br>

      <li>She would always tell us “Manners makes the man”.</li>
      <br>

      <li>Our Mom made us memorize this and say it every night before we went to bed growing up.</li>
      <br>
    </ul>

    <h3 class = "prayer">The Lords Prayer</h3>
      <h4 class = "memorize">Our Mom made us memorize this and say it every night before we went to bed growing up.</h4>

      <p>Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.</p>
