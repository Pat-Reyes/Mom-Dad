  </section>
    <p>Thelma (Pat) Reyes was born March 1, 1932 to Frederick and Violet Cousins in Gillingham England</p>
    <p>She was the devoted wife to our Dad Antonio Reyes for 56 years and a loving mother to sons Tony and Paul. She will be deeply missed by all who knew her.</p>
    <p>Our mother was a kind, caring, and giving person who always put the needs of her family before her own. She was a strong woman who faced every challenge in her life with courage and dignity.</p>
    <p>She met a lot of challenges at an early age. At the age of 10 her Dad was killed during the battle of the Barents Sea while serving on the HMS Achates during World War II. This left her Mother to raise her and three other siblings on her own.</p>
    <p>During World War II in Oxford England our Mother and her family always faced the possibility of being bombed by the enemy and had to spend a lot of time practicing going to bomb shelters and how to use gas masks. Because of this and more our mother was a source of inspiration to us all and she will be deeply missed by everyone whose lives she touched.</p>
    <p>Growing up our mother was always there for us, whether we needed help with school or just a shoulder to cry on. Although crying couldn’t be for anything silly because then she would say “I will give you something to cry about”. This tough love molded us to be successful throughout both of our lives. She was a woman of strong faith and she instilled in us the importance of family, hard work and doing what is right. Our mother was a true role model who we will always look up to.</p>
